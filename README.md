# Intro to Machine Learning

[Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) is a course offered by Udacity and taught by Katie Malone and Sebastian Thrun that serves as an introduction to the world of machine learning.

In order to check that your environment is ready and to download the data (note that this may take some time), run:

```bash
python tools/startup.py
```

To have the same environment as in the course, use [environment.yml](environment.yml) file to create the corresponding environment. For example, with [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/intro.html) package manager:

```bash
conda env --create -f environment.yml
```
